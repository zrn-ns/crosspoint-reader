# CrossPoint Reader CJK

**[English](./README.md)** | [中文](./README-ZH.md) | [日本語](./README-JA.md)

> A CJK adapted version of the **Xteink X4** e-ink reader firmware based on [daveallie/crosspoint-reader](https://github.com/daveallie/crosspoint-reader).

This project adapts the original CrossPoint Reader for CJK support, featuring a multi-language interface and CJK font rendering.

## ✨ New CJK Features

- **Complete Localization**: Supports Chinese, English, and Japanese interface languages.
- Switch interface language anytime in Settings.
- All menus, prompts, and settings are fully localized.

### 📝 CJK Font System

- **External Font Support**:
  - **Reading Font**: Used for book content (selectable size and font family).
  - **UI Font**: Used for menus, titles, and the interface.
  - Font sharing option: Use the reading font as the UI font to save memory.
- LRU cache optimization to improve CJK rendering performance.

## 📥 Installation

### Upstream Web Flashing

1. Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C
2. Download the `firmware.bin` file from the release of your choice via the [releases page](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/releases)
3. Go to https://xteink.dve.al/ and flash the firmware file using the "OTA fast flash controls" section

### Web Flashing (Recommended)

1. Connect the Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C.
2. Visit https://xteink-flasher-cjk.vercel.app/ and click **"Flash CrossPoint CJK firmware"** to flash the latest CJK firmware directly.

> **Tip**: To restore official firmware or the original CrossPoint firmware, use the same page. To switch the boot partition, visit https://xteink-flasher-cjk.vercel.app/debug.

### Manual Compilation

#### Requirements

* **PlatformIO Core** (`pio`)
* Python 3.8+
* USB-C Cable
* Xteink X4

#### Get Code

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aBER0724/crosspoint-reader-cjk

# Or, if you've already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### Build & Flash

Run the following command after connecting the device:

```bash
pio run --target upload
```
### Debugging

After flashing the new features, it’s recommended to capture detailed logs from the serial port.

First, make sure all required Python packages are installed:

```python
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```
after that run the script:
```sh
# For Linux
# This was tested on Debian and should work on most Linux systems.
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# For macOS
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```
Minor adjustments may be required for Windows.

## 🔠 Fonts

### Font Generation

- `tools/generate_cjk_ui_font.py`

- [DotInk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dotink-eink-assistant/id6754073002) (Recommended: Use DotInk to generate reading fonts for a better preview of how the font looks on the device).

### Font Configuration

1. Create a `fonts/` folder in the root directory of the SD card.
2. Place font files in `.bin` format into the folder.
3. Select "Reader/Reader Font" or "Display/UI Font" in settings.

**Font File Naming Format**: `FontName_size_WxH.bin`

Examples:
- `SourceHanSansCN-Medium_20_20x20.bin` (UI: 20pt, 20x20)
- `KingHwaOldSong_38_33x39.bin` (Reading: 38pt, 33x39)

**Font Description**:
- **Reading Font**: Used for book content text.
- **UI Font**: Used for menus, titles, and interface elements.

> Due to memory constraints, the built-in font uses a very small Chinese character set, containing only the characters required for the UI.
> It is recommended to store more complete UI and reading fonts on the SD card for a better experience.
> If generating fonts is inconvenient, you can download the example fonts provided above.

## ℹ️ FAQ

1. For chapters with many pages, indexing may take longer on first open. This has been significantly improved with the streaming CSS parser, but very large chapters may still require a few seconds.
    > If the device remains stuck indexing after a reboot and fails to complete for a long time, preventing you from returning to other pages, please re-flash the firmware.
2. If stuck on a specific interface, try restarting the device.
3. The ESP32-C3 has very limited memory. Using large CJK font files for both UI and reading fonts simultaneously may cause out-of-memory crashes. It is recommended to keep UI fonts at 20pt or below.
4. When opening the home screen for the first time after adding new books, the device will generate cover thumbnails. A "Loading" popup may appear for a few seconds — this is normal, not a freeze.
