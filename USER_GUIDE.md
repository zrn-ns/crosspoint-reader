## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xteink X4 (in the same layout as the manufacturer firmware, by default):

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right**           |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**, **Reset** |

Button layout can be customized in the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)**.

### Taking a Screenshot
When the Power Button and Volume Down button are pressed at the same time, it will take a screenshot and save it in the folder `screenshots/`.

Alternatively, while reading a book, press the **Confirm** button to open the reader menu and select **Take screenshot**.

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for approximately half a second**.
In the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)** you can configure the power button to turn the device off with a short press instead of a long one.

To reboot the device (for example after a firmware update or if it's frozen), press and release the Reset button, and then quickly press and hold the Power button for a few seconds.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home screen is the main entry point to the firmware. From here you can navigate to **[Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode)** with the most recently read book, the **[Browse Files](#33-browse-files-screen)** screen, the **[Recent Books](#34-recent-books-screen)** screen, the **[File Transfer](#35-file-transfer-screen)** screen, or **[Settings](#36-settings)**.

### 3.2 Reading Mode

See [Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.3 Browse Files Screen

The Browse Files screen acts as a file and folder browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up and down through folders and books. You can also long-press these buttons to scroll a full page up or down.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book. 
* **Delete Files:** Hold and release **Confirm** to delete the selected file. You will be given an option to either confirm or cancel deletion. Folder deletion is not supported.

### 3.4 Recent Books Screen

The Recent Books screen lists the most recently opened books in a chronological view, displaying title and author.

### 3.5 File Transfer Screen

The File Transfer screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted with a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

> [!TIP]
> Advanced users can also manage files programmatically or via the command line using `curl`. See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for details.

### 3.5.1 Calibre Wireless Transfers

CrossPoint supports sending books from Calibre using the CrossPoint Reader device plugin.

1. Install the plugin in Calibre:
   - Head to https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/calibre-plugins/releases to download the latest version of the crosspoint_reader plugin.
   - Download the zip file.
   - Open Calibre → Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file → Select the zip file.
2. On the device: File Transfer → Connect to Calibre → Join a network.
3. Make sure your computer is on the same WiFi network.
4. In Calibre, click "Send to device" to transfer books.

- **Language**: Set the system language (see **[Supported Languages](#supported-languages)** for more information).

#### 3.6.5 OPDS Servers (Multiple Libraries)

CrossPoint supports saving multiple OPDS servers and switching between them when browsing catalogs.

1. Open **Settings -> System -> OPDS Servers**.
2. Select **Add Server** to create a new entry, or select an existing server to edit it.
3. Configure these fields:
  - **Server Name**: Optional display name (for example, "Home Calibre" or "Public Catalog").
  - **OPDS Server URL**: Full catalog root URL (for Calibre Content Server, usually ends with `/opds`).
  - **Username / Password**: Optional credentials for authenticated servers.
4. Use **Delete Server** inside a server entry to remove it.

Behavior notes:

- You can store up to 8 OPDS servers.
- OPDS authentication supports HTTP Basic auth. If you use Calibre Content Server with authentication enabled, set it to Basic (not Digest).

You can also manage OPDS servers from the web interface while in File Transfer mode:

1. Connect to the device web UI.
2. Open `http://<device-ip>/settings`.
3. Use the **OPDS Servers** card to add, edit, or delete entries.

#### 3.6.6 KOReader Sync Quick Setup

CrossPoint can sync reading progress with KOReader-compatible sync servers.
It also interoperates with KOReader apps/devices when they use the same server and credentials.

##### Option A: Free Public Server (`sync.koreader.rocks`)

1. Register a user once (only if needed):

```bash
USERNAME="user"
PASSWORD="pass"
PASSWORD_MD5="$(printf '%s' "$PASSWORD" | openssl md5 | awk '{print $2}')"

curl -i "https://sync.koreader.rocks/users/create" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.koreader.v1+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"username\":\"$USERNAME\",\"password\":\"$PASSWORD_MD5\"}"
```

Already have KOReader Sync credentials? Skip registration; basic sync only requires using the same existing username/password on all devices.

When this returns `HTTP 402` with `{"code":2002,"message":"Username is already registered."}`, pick a different username or use that existing account.

2. On each CrossPoint device:
   - Go to **Settings -> System -> KOReader Sync**.
   - Set **Username** and **Password** (enter the plain password; CrossPoint computes MD5 internally, and use the same values on all devices).
   - Set **Sync Server URL** to `https://sync.koreader.rocks`, or leave it empty (both use the same default KOReader sync server).
   - Run **Authenticate**.

3. While reading, press **Confirm** to open the reader menu, then select **Sync Progress**.
   - Choose **Apply Remote** to jump to remote progress.
   - Choose **Upload Local** to push current progress.

##### Option B: Self-Hosted Server (Docker Compose)

1. Start a sync server:

```bash
mkdir -p kosync-quickstart
cd kosync-quickstart

cat > compose.yaml <<'YAML'
services:
  kosync:
    image: koreader/kosync:latest
    ports:
      - "7200:7200"
      - "17200:17200"
    volumes:
      - ./data/redis:/var/lib/redis
    environment:
      - ENABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=true
    restart: unless-stopped
YAML

# Docker
docker compose up -d

# Podman (alternative)
podman compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> `ENABLE_USER_REGISTRATION=true` is convenient for first setup. After creating your users, set it to `false` (or remove it) to avoid unexpected registrations.

2. Verify the server:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.koreader.v1+json" "http://<server-ip>:17200/healthcheck"
# Expected: {"state":"OK"}
```

3. Register a user once.
CrossPoint authenticates against KOReader Sync (`koreader/kosync`) using an MD5 key, so register using the MD5 of your password:

> [!WARNING]
> Sending a reusable MD5-derived password over plain HTTP is insecure.
> Create unique sync-only credentials and do not reuse main account passwords.
> Prefer `https://<server-ip>:7200` whenever traffic leaves a fully trusted LAN or when using untrusted networks.
> Use `curl -k` only for self-signed certificate testing.

```bash
USERNAME="user"
PASSWORD="pass"
PASSWORD_MD5="$(printf '%s' "$PASSWORD" | openssl md5 | awk '{print $2}')"

curl -i "http://<server-ip>:17200/users/create" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.koreader.v1+json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"username\":\"$USERNAME\",\"password\":\"$PASSWORD_MD5\"}"
```

If this returns `HTTP 402` with `{"code":2002,"message":"Username is already registered."}`, the account already exists.

4. On each CrossPoint device:
   - Go to **Settings -> System -> KOReader Sync**.
   - Set **Username** and **Password** (enter the plain password; CrossPoint computes MD5 internally, and use the same values on all devices).
   - Set **Sync Server URL** to `http://<server-ip>:17200`.
   - Run **Authenticate**.

If you use the HTTPS listener, use `https://<server-ip>:7200` (`curl -k` only for self-signed certificate testing).

5. While reading, press **Confirm** to open the reader menu, then select **Sync Progress**.
   - Choose **Apply Remote** to jump to remote progress.
   - Choose **Upload Local** to push current progress.

### 3.7 Sleep Screen

The **Sleep Screen** setting controls what is displayed when the device goes to sleep:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Dark** (default) | The CrossPoint logo on a dark background. |
| **Light** | The CrossPoint logo on a white background. |
| **Custom** | A custom image from the SD card (see below). Falls back to **Dark** if no custom image is found. |
| **Cover** | The cover of the currently open book. Falls back to **Dark** if no book is open. |
| **Cover + Custom** | The cover of the currently open book. Falls back to **Custom** behavior if no book is open. |
| **None** | A blank screen. |

#### Cover settings

When using **Cover** or **Cover + Custom**, two additional settings apply:

- **Sleep Screen Cover Mode**: **Fit** (scale to fit, white borders) or **Crop** (scale and crop to fill the screen).
- **Sleep Screen Cover Filter**: **None** (grayscale), **Contrast** (black & white), or **Inverted** (inverted black & white).

#### Custom images

To use custom sleep images, set the sleep screen mode to **Custom** or **Cover + Custom**, then place images on the SD card:

- **Multiple Images (recommended):** Create a `.sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images inside. One will be randomly selected each time the device sleeps. (A directory named `sleep` is also accepted as a fallback.)
- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory. This is used as a fallback if no valid images are found in the `.sleep`/`sleep` directory.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth
> - X4: Use a resolution of 480x800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.
> - X3: Use a resolution of 528x792 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.

## 4. Reading Mode

Once you have opened a book, the button layout changes to facilitate reading.

### Page Turning
| Action            | Buttons                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Previous Page** | Press **Left** _or_ **Volume Up**    |
| **Next Page**     | Press **Right** _or_ **Volume Down** |

The role of the volume (side) buttons can be swapped in the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)**.

If the **Short Power Button Click** setting is set to "Page Turn", you can also turn to the next page by briefly pressing the Power button.

### Chapter Navigation
* **Next Chapter:** Press and **hold** the **Right** (or **Volume Down**) button briefly, then release.
* **Previous Chapter:** Press and **hold** the **Left** (or **Volume Up**) button briefly, then release.

This feature can be disabled in the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)** to help avoid changing chapters by mistake.


### System Navigation
* **Return to Home:** Press the **Back** button to close the book and return to the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.
* **Return to Browse Files:** Press and hold the **Back** button to close the book and return to the **[Browse Files](#33-browse-files-screen)** screen.
* **Chapter Menu:** Press **Confirm** to open the **[Table of Contents/Chapter Selection](#5-chapter-selection-screen)** screen.

### Supported Languages

CrossPoint renders text using the following Unicode character blocks, enabling support for a wide range of languages:

## 5. Chapter Selection Screen

Accessible by pressing **Confirm** while inside a book.

1.  Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to highlight the desired chapter.
2.  Press **Confirm** to jump to that chapter.
3.  *Alternatively, press **Back** to cancel and return to your current page.*

---

## 6. Current Limitations & Roadmap

Please note that this firmware is currently in active development. The following features are **not yet supported** but are planned for future updates:

* **Images:** Embedded images in e-books will not render.
* **Cover Images:** Large cover images embedded into EPUB require several seconds (~10s for ~2000 pixel tall image) to convert for sleep screen and home screen thumbnail. Consider optimizing the EPUB with e.g. https://github.com/bigbag/epub-to-xtc-converter to speed this up.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Issues & Escaping Bootloop

If an issue or crash is encountered while using Crosspoint, feel free to raise an issue ticket and attach the serial monitor logs. The logs can be obtained by connecting the device to a computer and starting a serial monitor. Either [Serial Monitor](https://www.serialmonitor.org/) or the following command can be used:

```
pio device monitor
```

If the device is stuck in a bootloop, press and release the Reset button. Then, press and hold on to the configured Back button and the Power Button to boot to the Home Screen.

There can be issues with broken cache or config. In this case, delete the `.crosspoint` directory on your SD card (or consider deleting only `settings.bin`, `state.bin`, or `epub_*` cache directories in the `.crosspoint/` folder).
