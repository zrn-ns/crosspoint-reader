## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xteink X4 (in the same layout as the manufacturer firmware, by default):

### Button Layout
| Location        | Buttons                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bottom Edge** | **Back**, **Confirm**, **Left**, **Right**           |
| **Right Side**  | **Power**, **Volume Up**, **Volume Down**, **Reset** |

Button layout can be customized in the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)**.

### Taking a Screenshot
When the Power Button and Volume Down button are pressed at the same time, it will take a screenshot and save it in the folder `screenshots/`.

Alternatively, while reading a book, press the **Confirm** button to open the reader menu and select **Take screenshot**.

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for approximately half a second**.
In the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)** you can configure the power button to turn the device off with a short press instead of a long one.

To reboot the device (for example after a firmware update or if it's frozen), press and release the Reset button, and then quickly press and hold the Power button for a few seconds.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **[Home](#31-home-screen)** screen.

> [!NOTE]
> On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading.

---

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home screen is the main entry point to the firmware. From here you can navigate to **[Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode)** with the most recently read book, the **[Browse Files](#33-browse-files-screen)** screen, the **[Recent Books](#34-recent-books-screen)** screen, the **[File Transfer](#35-file-transfer-screen)** screen, or **[Settings](#36-settings)**.

### 3.2 Reading Mode

See [Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.3 Browse Files Screen

The Browse Files screen acts as a file and folder browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up and down through folders and books. You can also long-press these buttons to scroll a full page up or down.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.

### 3.4 Recent Books Screen

The Recent Books screen lists the most recently opened books in a chronological view, displaying title and author.

### 3.5 File Transfer Screen

The File Transfer screen allows you to upload new e-books to the device. When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted with a WiFi selection dialog and then your X4 will start hosting a web server.

See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for more information on how to connect to the web server and upload files.

> [!TIP]
> Advanced users can also manage files programmatically or via the command line using `curl`. See the [webserver docs](./docs/webserver.md) for details.

### 3.5.1 Calibre Wireless Transfers

CrossPoint supports sending books from Calibre using the CrossPoint Reader device plugin.

1. Install the plugin in Calibre:
   - Head to https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/calibre-plugins/releases to download the latest version of the crosspoint_reader plugin.
   - Download the zip file.
   - Open Calibre → Preferences → Plugins → Load plugin from file → Select the zip file.
2. On the device: File Transfer → Connect to Calibre → Join a network.
3. Make sure your computer is on the same WiFi network.
4. In Calibre, click "Send to device" to transfer books.

- **Language**: Set the system language (see **[Supported Languages](#supported-languages)** for more information).

### 3.7 Sleep Screen

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

> [!TIP]
> For best results:
> - Use uncompressed BMP files with 24-bit color depth
> - Use a resolution of 480x800 pixels to match the device's screen resolution.

## 4. Reading Mode

Once you have opened a book, the button layout changes to facilitate reading.

### Page Turning

The role of the volume (side) buttons can be swapped in the **[Controls Settings](#363-controls)**.

If the **Short Power Button Click** setting is set to "Page Turn", you can also turn to the next page by briefly pressing the Power button.

### Chapter Navigation
* **Next Chapter:** Press and **hold** the **Right** (or **Volume Down**) button briefly, then release.

## 5. Chapter Selection Screen

Accessible by pressing **Confirm** while inside a book.

1.  Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to highlight the desired chapter.
2.  Press **Confirm** to jump to that chapter.
3.  *Alternatively, press **Back** to cancel and return to your current page.*

---

## 6. Current Limitations & Roadmap

Please note that this firmware is currently in active development. The following features are **not yet supported** but are planned for future updates:

* **Images:** Embedded images in e-books will not render.
* **Cover Images:** Large cover images embedded into EPUB require several seconds (~10s for ~2000 pixel tall image) to convert for sleep screen and home screen thumbnail. Consider optimizing the EPUB with e.g. https://github.com/bigbag/epub-to-xtc-converter to speed this up.

## 7. Troubleshooting Issues & Escaping Bootloop

If an issue or crash is encountered while using Crosspoint, feel free to raise an issue ticket and attach the serial monitor logs. The logs can be obtained by connecting the device to a computer and starting a serial monitor. Either [Serial Monitor](https://www.serialmonitor.org/) or the following command can be used:

```
pio device monitor
```

If the device is stuck in a bootloop, press and release the Reset button. Then, press and hold on to the configured Back button and the Power Button to boot to the Home Screen.

There can be issues with broken cache or config. In this case, delete the `.crosspoint` directory on your SD card (or consider deleting only `settings.bin`, `state.bin`, or `epub_*` cache directories in the `.crosspoint/` folder).
